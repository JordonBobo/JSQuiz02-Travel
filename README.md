### Description
Updated version of the ealier JS quiz. Rather than 1 score, this one has different scores depending on the 4 possible outcomes. At the end of the test, whichever score is highest decides what result to display. There is no timer or stored results in this version. Some attention was given to the CSS, but this is still meant to be a demostration of functionality rather than a final product.
